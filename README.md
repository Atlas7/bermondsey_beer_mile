# Bermondsey Beer Mile

A handy guide for a Saturday Bermondsey Beer Mile - Micro-brewery Crawl along the Railway Arches between South Bermondsey and London Bridge.

Probably best do this on Saturdays when most breweries are opened for visitors. (e.g. start from 11:00 ish and finish by around 17:00 ish)
